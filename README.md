# Portfolix

Portfolix is my online Portfolio / Resume website. The website was written in Flask framework with Python. It is a static website using a template from [Bootstrapmade](https://bootstrapmade.com/)

I've added the code to my GitHub repo so that anyone can have a look at it.

Portfolix has currently been deployed on [Prometheus](https://github.com/mervin16/Prometheus)

Take a look at the live version [here](https://mervin-hemaraju.com).
